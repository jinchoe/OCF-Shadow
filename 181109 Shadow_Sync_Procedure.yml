Payload:

{
   "di": "Original_Device_ID"
   "ttl": 600,
   "sre": [{"ep": "coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"}],
   "dre": [{"ep": "coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"}],

         "rt": ["oic.r.temperature"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],
         "temperature": 20,
         "units": "C"
       }
     },
     {
       "href": "/oic/d",
       "p": {"bm": 1},
       "rep": {
         "rt": ["oic.wk.d", "oic.d.sensor"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],

         "dmn": "foo labs",
         "dmno": "bar product xxx"
       }
     }
   ]
}

The newly created Shadow Device has "oic.wk.shadow.info" as below

{
  "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.info"],
  "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
  "odi": "Original_Device_ID",
  "ode": ["coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"],
  "isSynched": false
  "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000111
}

(lastSyncTimestamp is merely initialized here to the timestamp it received in the request to "oic.wk.shadow.gen".)

2.2) Response to Shadow Device Generation  
Shadow Service to Original Device 
<- OK

Payload:

[
  { "href": "/oic/shadow/sync",
    "anchor": "ocf://Shadow_Device_di",
    "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.sync"],
    "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
    "p": {"bm": 0},
    "eps": [{"ep": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"}]
  },
  { "href": "/oic/res",
    "anchor": "ocf://Shadow_Device_di",
    "rt": ["oic.wk.res"],
    "if": ["oic.if.r", "oic.if.baseline"],
    "p": {"bm": 3},
    "eps": [{"ep": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"}]
  }
]

Upon receiving the Response, the original Device updates
its "oic.wk.shadow.conf" with the information in the payload as below:

{
   "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.conf"],
   "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
   "si": "Shadow_Service_ID",
   "sgr": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:1111/oic/shadow/gen",
   "sgi": true,
   "sdi": "Shadow_Device_ID",     
   "sde": ["coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"],
   "isSynched": false,     
   "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000111
}

(Upon receiving this confirmation of Shadow Device creation, 
the Original Device additionally sets its record of lastSyncTimestamp
to match the timestamp it first sent out in the shadowgen request payload.)

3. Shadow Device Onboarding

3.1) Acquire information about Shadow Device
OBT to Original Device
-> GET /oic/shadows/conf
<- OK

{
   "si": "Shadow_Service_ID",
   "sgr": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:1111/oic/shadow/gen",
   "sgi": true,
   "sdi": "Shadow_Device_ID",     
   "sde": ["coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"],
   "isSynched": false,     
   "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000111
}

3.2) Shadow Device Ownership
OBT to Shadow Device
Take Ownership of Shadow Device
(Discover SVRs (Secure Virtual Resources) via /oic/res
located at endpoint "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222" and
perform OTM sequence)
 
3.3) Credential/ACL Provisioning
OBT provisions both the Original Device and Shadow Device to establish secure communications
OBT constructs appropriate credential (e.g. pairwise symmetric key)

OBT to Shadow Device
-> Provision credential to Shadow Device using existing procedures
citing Original Device's di as subjectuuid.
<- OK

-> Provision ACE in Shadow Device's acl2 giving Original Device access to its /oic/shadow/sync.
<- OK

OBT to Original Device
-> Provision credential to Original Device using existing procedures
citing Shadow Device's di as subjectuuid.
<- OK

-> Provision ACE in Original Device's acl2 giving Shadow Device access to its
/oic/shadow/sync.
<- OK

3.4) Activate Synchronization  
Now that the Original and Shadow Devices are linked via the OBT, 
they are fully set up to synchronize their states securely between each other
whenever required.

OBT to Original Device
-> POST /oic/shadow/conf

Payload:

{
  "isSynched": true
}

<- OK

OBT to Shadow Device
-> POST /oic/shadow/info

Payload:
{
  "isSynched": true
}

<- OK

** End of Shadow device generation and onboarding procedures **

State of /oic/shadow/conf in Original Device

{
   "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.conf"],
   "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
   "si": "Shadow_Service_ID",
   "sgr": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:1111/oic/shadow/gen",
   "sgi": true,
   "sdi": "Shadow_Device_ID",     
   "sde": ["coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"],
   "isSynched": true,     
   "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000111
}

State of /oic/shadow/info on Shadow Device
{
  "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.info"],
  "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
  "odi": "original_Device_ID",
  "ode": ["coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"],
  "isSynched": true
  "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000111        
}

**

4. Shadow Device Synchronization 
4.1) Original Device synchronizing with the Shadow Device

Original Devices notices a change in resource state (event from sensor, etc.) at timestamp 1124000333.
It updates its sync resource, and kicks off a synchronization request to the Shadow Device.

Original Device to Shadow Device
-> POST /oic/shadow/sync (request sent to "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:44444")

Payload:

{
  "di": "Original_Device_ID", 
  "timestamp": 1124000333
  "resources": [
    {
      "href": "/temperature",
      "rep": {
        "temperature": 25
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "/oic/d",
      "rep": {
        "n": "myLivingRoomTemperatureSensor"
      }
    }
  ]
}
 
The Shadow Device notes that the timestamp in the request is > that its lastSyncTimestamp.
The Shadow Device updates its copy resourcesâ€™ states accordingly.

The Shadow Device updates its lastSyncTimestamp in its  /oic/shadow/info resource to

{
  "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.info"],
  "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
  "odi": "original_Device_ID",
  "ode": ["coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"],
  "isSynched": true
  "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000333        
}

The Shadow Device's sync resource responds with the entire representations of all Shadowed resources
while also echoing back the timestamp.

<- OK

Payload:

{
  "timestamp": 1124000333
  "resources": [
     {
       "href": "/temperature",
       "p": {"bm": 1},
       "rep": {
         "rt": ["oic.r.temperature"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],
         "temperature": 25,
         "units": "C"
       }
     },
     {
       "href": "/oic/d",
       "p": {"bm": 1},
       "rep": {
         "rt": ["oic.wk.d", "oic.d.sensor"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],
         "di": "ec70373c-1e8d-4fb3-962e-017eaa863989",
         "icv": "ocf.2.0.0",
         "dmv": "ocf.res.1.0.0",
         "dmn": "foo labs",
         "dmno": "bar product xxx"
         "n": "myLivingRoomTemperatureSensor"
       }
     }
   ]
}

The Original Device notices that the timestamp in the response from the Shadow Device matches the timestamp recorded
in its original resource. So, it does not bother updating any values.

The Original Device however updates its lastSyncTimestamp in its oic.wk.shadow.conf resource. Its updated state is:

{
   "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.conf"],
   "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
   "si": "Shadow_Service_ID",
   "sgr": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:1111/oic/shadow/gen",
   "sgi": true,
   "sdi": "Shadow_Device_ID",     
   "sde": ["coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"],
   "isSynched": true,     
   "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000333
}
 

4.2) Shadow Device synchronizes with the Original Device
OCF Client X issues a POST request to /temperature on the Shadow Device resulting in a change in state.

OCF Client X POST /temperature on the Shadow Device at timestamp
0000000555

Payload:

{
    "temperature": 45
}

<- ACK (just acknowledgement of request, but not confirmation.
In CoAP this is called a separate response (as against piggybacked
response))

Shadow Device records the pending Request and its timestamp 0000000555  

[Jin comments] You wrote that the above is recorded in "oic.wk.shadow.sync"
but, IMO, it can be kept in some internal storage/cache. 

Shadow Device DOES NOT update state of /temperature resource until synchronization is complete and confirmed.

It knows this because timestamp on the sync resource is > lastSyncTimestamp in its /oic/shadow/info.
So, for e.g. if during this time some OCF Client Y issues:

GET /temperature on Shadow Device
<- OK

Payload:

{
    "temperature": 25
}

The Shadowed resource returns the old value.

Shadow Device sends a synchrnoization request to the Original
Device

POST /oic/shadow/sync

Payload:

{
  "di": "Shadow_Device_ID", 
  "timestamp": 1124000555
  "resources": [
    {
      "href": "/temperature",
      "rep": {
        "temperature": 45
     }
  ]
}

The Original Device notices that the timestamp recorded in its sync resource is behind the timestamp in the sync request and
proceeds to update state for all shadowed resources.

At the same time the Original Device updates its lastSyncTimestamp for the Shadow Device as recorded in the shadowconf resource:

{
   "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.conf"],
   "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
   "si": "Shadow_Service_ID",
   "sgr": "coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:1111/oic/shadow/gen",
   "sgi": true,
   "sdi": "Shadow_Device_di",     
   "sde": ["coaps://[fe80::b1d6]:2222"],
   "isSynched": true,     
   "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000555
}

The Original Device then responds with its updated state and timestamp (matching that of the request) along with entire
representations of all synched resources.

<- OK

Payload:

{
  "timestamp": 1124000555
   "resources": [
     {
       "href": "/temperature",
       "p": {"bm": 1},
       "rep": {
         "rt": ["oic.r.temperature"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],
         "temperature": 45,
         "units": "C"
       }
     },
     {
       "href": "/oic/d",
       "p": {"bm": 1},
       "rep": {
         "rt": ["oic.wk.d", "oic.d.sensor"],
         "if": ["oic.if.s", "oic.if.baseline"],
         "di": "ec70373c-1e8d-4fb3-962e-017eaa863989",
         "icv": "ocf.2.0.0",
         "dmv": "ocf.res.1.0.0",
         "dmn": "foo labs",
         "dmno": "bar product xxx"
         "n": "myLivingRoomTemperatureSensor"
       }
     }
   ]
}

The Shadow Device receives this response and notices that the timestamps match and hence does not alter the sync resource.
Tbe Shadow Device however notices that it needs to update its lastSyncTimestamp in /oic/shadow/info as timestamp in the sync
resource > lastSyncTimestamp.

Updated state of /oic/shadow/info:

{
  "rt": ["oic.wk.shadow.info"],
  "if": ["oic.if.rw", "oic.if.baseline"],
  "odi": "original_Device_ID",
  "ode": ["coaps://[fe80::b1e6]:55555"],
  "isSynched": true
  "lastSyncTimestamp": 1124000555        
}

After it updates lastSyncTimestamp, it updates the state of its /temperature resource and finally handles all outstanding
(separate) responses to Clients.

Shadow Device to OCF Client X (separate response in CoAP):
<- OK

Payload:
{
    "temperature": 45
}
